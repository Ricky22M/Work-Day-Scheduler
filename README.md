# Work Day Scheduler

Have you ever wanted to plan out your work day? Well you're in luck because this application allows you, the user, to organize a schedule that is suitable for a 9 AM to 5 PM work schedule. How this application works is allowing the user to take down notes on certain hours of the day, which this application follows the user's date and time to fit their note-taking experience, and keeps track of what needs to be done throughout the day. An amazing feature that this application also has in store is saving the note-taking process and keeps the user's notes saved through the user's device so that no progress can be lost when getting off or refreshing the application.
